# Medygon ðŸ‘¾

This project was a part of Ingenious Hackathon 3.0

## Overview
- Blockchain-based medical records on Polygon's Matic network 
- Medygon solves the problem of tampering with medical records through blockchain's immutability.
- Currently, Doctors and Patients are the stakeholders considered in the transaction.
- Initially, the Patient grants access to the Doctor.
- Only after that, the Doctor can view the patient in his/her list and add documents for that Patient.
- The uploaded report can be viewed by the Patient - and each upload is identified by the Doctor's public key.

## Pre-requisities

Node, npm, Truffle, Ganache, React, Metamask
